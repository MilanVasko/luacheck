`Luacheck <https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck/>`_ is a tool for linting and static analysis of `Lua <http://www.lua.org/>`_ code. It is able to spot usage of undefined global variables, unused local variables and a few other typical problems within Lua programs.

Luacheck provides a command line interface as well as a Lua module which can be used by other programs.

This is the documentation for the 0.7.1 version.
